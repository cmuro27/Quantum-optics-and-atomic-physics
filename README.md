# Quantum optics and atomic physics scripts.   
 Wolfram Mathematica and Python scripts to perform some quantum optics and atomic physics calculations as:  
-To obtain and visualize the the Wigner and Hussimi functions of coherent states, Fock states, and Schr√∂dinger cat states.    
-To obtain the Cesium hyperfine structure in an external magnetic field.  
-Electromagnetically induced transparency in Rubidium 87 in a Lambda model and light storage.  
-Excitation dynamics of interacting Rydberg atoms in small lattices employing Ising model.
